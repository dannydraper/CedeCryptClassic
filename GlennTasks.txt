Tooltips on controls

	- When cancelling folder encryption, there is no feedback as to what will happen
		- need a warning message to tell the user what will happen

Protected Folders:
	- Need to place an Ok button on the dialog
	- Make the window a modal dialog


When decrypting/encrypting protected folders
	- Use a system tray icon instead of progress dialog
	- If you remove a protected folder, then you can't delete the folder itself
		presumably because there is a lock on the folder.
	
Distribution Manager:
	- Think about password policy management
