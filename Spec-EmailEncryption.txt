1) Highlight some text in any window

2) Press Ctrl-E to Encrypt
	- Register a system-wide hotkey - Done on application startup
		- RESEARCH: Register systemwide hotkey
	- As soon as Hotkey is triggered, use SendKeys to do a Ctrl-X to cut the text to the clipboard
		- void SendCtrlCut ()	- PREVIOUSSOURCE: LiveDesktop2
	- Grab a handle to the active window (for later activating)
		- RESEARCH: Grab the current active window
	- Open the clipboard and Read the Text
		- bool ClipTextToMemoryBuffer (out MemoryBuffer)   - PREVIOUSSOURCE: VirtuaJump

3) Has the user set a default Encryption password?

	If Yes, then NO password prompt - Text is Encrypted

	If No, then Password prompt - Text is Encrypted after password is entered

	When Encrypting:
		- Clipboard Data read to Memory Buffer
		- Encrypted data needs to be text-readable, need a function to convert encrypted buffer to text readable data
			- void MemoryBufferToReadableText ()
		- Also need a function to convert text readable encrypted buffer, to standard encrypted byte byffer (reverse of above)
			- void ReadableTextToMemoryBuffer ()
				- bool VerifyReadableText ()

		- After encrypted to text readable format, clear the clipboard, and write encrypted readable text
			- void MemoryBufferToClipText ()
		- Switch back to window where Ctrl-E was triggered
			- RESEARCH: Activate relevant window
		- Use Send Keys to do a Ctrl-V
			- void SendCtrlPaste ()
