Setup blank Key Canvas in CedeCrypt.exe

generate guid needed to locate start and end of distribution name canvas
Setup blank distribution name canvas in CedeCrypt.exe

Remake the setup executable and ensure that no compression is applied to the

Generate test public key and put into canvas
	- will include a private key

Generate test distribution name and put into name canvas

Ensure test distribution name is read properly and displayed somewhere in cedecrypt application

Ensure test public key is read properly from resource when saving a ccr file
and the test public key (second one) is also used to encrypt the password
into the ccr file - make sure that the password is encrypted at the end
of the file so that ccr files are backward compatible

ensure recovery is possible using test private key using /rp

ensure cedecsoft recovery still works using /r
